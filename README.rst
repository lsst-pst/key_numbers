Rubin Observatory System & LSST Survey Key Numbers
##################################################

This repository holds the source and detailed calculations for all Key Numbers that decribe the Rubin Observatory System & LSST Survey. The `public user-facing page <https://www.lsst.org/scientists/keynumbers>`_ of Rubin Observatory System & LSST Survey Key Numbers is derived from the source in this repository.

This repository should be the single source for metrics, quantities or notes or science estimates that are frequently looked up for talks.  


######
Inputs
######

To date there have been several reference documents quoting the baseline configuration and key numbers. All should be reviewed, the relevant information migrated to this repository and then deprecated. 

* `LSST Key Numbers confluence <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/LKB/LSST+Key+Numbers>`_ LSST Key System Parameters Summary
* `Document-16 <https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-16>`_ excel spreadsheet contains the LSST baseline configuration from 2009-04. 
* `Document-4169 <https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-4169>`_ excel spreadsheet contains the LSST baseline configuration from 2009-04. 
* `Document-16168 <https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Services/Document-16168>`_
* `Collection-886 <https://www.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/View/Collection-886>`_

LSST throughput curves are described in https://github.com/lsst/throughputs/tree/master/baseline

Outputs
#######

A pdf document of the numbers in this repository can be generated for versioning and citation,  and uploaded to Docushare, if desired. 

####
TODO
####

 * The information from Document-16 needs to be reviewed. Informatin that is stil lrelevant should be migrated to this repository and the Document-16 deprecated. 
 * The original confluence page is very DM and data-volume centric. Should add basic metrics on collecting area, image quality, etc., to make it a more community-useful data sheet as well as a better resource for preparing and fact-checking talks.
 * Add nominal camera numbers, e.g number/pixel count of CCDs, oixel scale, readnoise, dark current, non-linearity, full well depth,  cross-talk, QE(lambda), lens reflectivities, expected gain. (Steve R added some already to the confluence page)
